# Event Management Dashboard

Events bring people together, foster connections, and build communities. However, discovering relevant events and managing registrations can often be fragmented and inconvenient. The Event Management Dashboard is a web-based platform designed to simplify event discovery, registration, and management while enabling meaningful feedback between attendees and organizers.
